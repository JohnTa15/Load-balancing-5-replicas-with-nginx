# Load-Balancing-5-replicas-with-nginx
This is a docker compose file that contains an nginx image and alpine image and I have connected them together.

# Nginx
*Nginx (pronounced "engine x" /ˌɛndʒɪnˈɛks/ EN-jin-EKS, stylized as NGINX) is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. The software was created by Igor Sysoev and publicly released in 2004. Nginx is free and open-source software, released under the terms of the 2-clause BSD license. A large fraction of web servers use Nginx, often as a load balancer.*

# Alpine
*Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox. The image is only 5 MB in size and has access to a package repository that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images. This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities and even production applications. Read more about Alpine Linux here and you can see how their mantra fits in right at home with Docker images.*
